This module configures the resultant image to use a specific activity group
within the Sugar Activity Update control panel applet.

It also causes all of the activities from that group to be downloaded and
installed in the build.

You must specify the activity group URL in the configuration. Example:

[sugar_activity_group]
url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities/G1G1


The install_activities option (default 1) can be set to 0 to disable the
build-time parsing/download/installation of activities from the activity
group URL. This will cause the activity group URL to be written into the
resultant build but the specified activities will not be downloaded or
installed. e.g.:

[sugar_activity_group]
url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities/G1G1
install_activities=0
