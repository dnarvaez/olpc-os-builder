The following documentation is for developers only. As kernel RPMs will
auto-install to the right places, you usually do not have to care about this.


=== PARTITIONED LAYOUT ===
On systems where 2 partitions are used (root and boot), OLPC OS builds
duplicate the boot contents in 2 places:

1. On the root filesystem, at /versions/pristine/hash/boot
   which in turn is hardlinked to /versions/run/hash/boot
   A booted system chroots into the /versions/run/hash root, so these files are
   then accessible at /boot.
   These files are not used during boot.

2. On the boot filesystem, which is mounted on a running system at /bootpart
   This is a versioned filesystem layout.
   OpenFirmware looks at the "boot" directory (a symlink in this case) on this
   partition during early boot in order to find the kernel and supporting
   files.

In other words, if you want to use a different kernel or initramfs then you
want to put the files in /bootpart/boot.

This duplication is a consequence of the olpc-update design, where updates
can currently only be presented as a single filesystem tree described by a
single contents manifest. That filesystem tree must remain in pristine
condition in order for future updates to happen efficiently.


=== UNPARTITIONED LAYOUT ===

On systems where only a single partition is used, there is no duplication
of files (although there are multiple links). However, on a booted system,
/boot is not (exactly) the location that OFW boots from.

On a booted system, you are typically not seeing the actual disk layout,
instead you are seeing a chroot (with various bind mounts to distort it
further) setup by the initramfs.

OFW boots from the real /boot, which is an indirect symlink to the real
/versions/pristine/x/boot. On a booted system, /boot corresponds to the
real /versions/run/x/boot. Therefore any files you put in /boot will not
be available to OFW at boot-time, and if you break the hard links of existing
files then your changes will also not take effect.
