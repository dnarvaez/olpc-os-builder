This module allows you to configure an OATS server used by olpc-update,
overriding the default of antitheft.laptop.org

Options:

server: the address of an OATS server to use

ignore_xs: by default, the OATS client always contacts the school server
before trying other servers (maybe not even trying them at all). set this to 1
to override this behaviour, the school server will not be tried. Useful in
deployments with good connectivity where antitheft is controlled in a central
location (as opposed to the specific school).

stream: the update stream - this is helpful when deploying different OS images
that query the same update server.

Example configuration:
[oats_cfg]
server=my-oats-server.mydeployment.com
ignore_xs=1
stream=xo15hs
