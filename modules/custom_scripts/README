This module allows you to run custom scripts/programs which are executed quite
late in the build process: after all packages have been installed and OLPC
tweak have been made, but before checksumming and packing everything into the
appropriate image format.

Usage of this module is discouraged -- olpc-os-builder aims to allow you to
make all customizations through the configuration file, and if that is not
possible, you are encouraged to write to the devel@lists.laptop.org mailing
list, requesting the development of a specific module to meet your needs.



Your scripts will run under bash in the regular environment of the system,
with root privileges. The environment variable $INSTALL_ROOT will be pre-set,
allowing you to locate and make any changes to the actual build through
reading this variable.

Your scripts should return 0 on success, a non-zero exit code will cause the
whole build process to fail.

You can execute binaries and programs instead of scripts, just make sure that
the file is market executable and that the appropriate binary identification
byte or shebang (e.g. #!/usr/bin/python) is present.

Example configuration:

[custom_scripts]
custom_script_1=/home/xobuilds/scripts/tweak-something.sh
custom_script_2=/home/xobuilds/scripts/fix-frobber.py
