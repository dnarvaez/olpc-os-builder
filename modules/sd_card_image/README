This module creates ext3 SD card images from the build output. These
images contain partition tables and 2 partitions.

It also produces .zd disk images from those images, suitable for
fs-update. Corresponding .zsp files are produced too.

The SD card sizes must be specified, in bytes. This module can create
filesystems for multiple SD card capacities. Simply provide a list of
uniquely-named options that start with "size_", one for each SD card size.

The value for each of these options is the disk size (in bytes), optionally
followed by a comma and a name. There can only be one un-named entry.

For example:
[sd_card_image]
; 3780mb
size_1=3964665000
; 1985mb
size_2=1977614336,2gb

The output files will be:

	(the 3780mb disk output)
	osXX.disk.img.tar.gz
	osXX.zd
	osXX.zsp

	(the 1985mb disk output)
	osXX.2gb.disk.img.tar.gz
	osXX.2gb.zd
	osXX.2gb.zsp

The .img file is archived in tar (in sparse mode) and then compressed with
gzip. Tar preserves the sparseness of the file (the fact that some part of the
image is made up of unallocated disk blocks). To disable this
archiving/compression, set the compress_disk_image option to 0 (default is 1).
