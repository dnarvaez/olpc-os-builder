This module installs sugar activities (.xo) and content bundles (.xol) from
a local directory. You must configure this directory.

Example:
[sugar_activities_extra]
local_dir=/path/to/my/activity/collection


It can install activities from remote URLs too, with uniquely named options
beginning with "url_", e.g.:

[sugar_activities_extra]
url_1=http://foo.com/MyActivity-1.xo
url_2=http://foo.com/MyContent-3.xol
